# Expense-Tracker

Our project aims to provide a financial management solution for users who tend to spend money recklessly. It allows users to manage their expenses effectively and encourages them to save money for emergencies or specific goals.

The application provides a user-friendly environment where users can input their daily expenses and choose to save a portion of their available balance. By using the "Savings" option, the user can enter the desired amount to be saved, and the system will automatically deduct it from the remaining balance, leaving only the spendable amount.

To avoid daily input, users can save their expenses in a text file using a text editor and import it into the application later, or provide input based on the saved data.

What sets our application apart from others in the market is its unique graph presentation with various options, making data visualization more engaging. Additionally, the project features an animated introduction, adding an element of interest for users.

In terms of security, the application ensures that all financial data, including inputs and remaining balances, are kept strictly between the user and the application, ensuring user privacy.

In summary, our financial management application provides a comprehensive solution for users to control their spending habits, save for future needs, and manage their finances efficiently and securely.
